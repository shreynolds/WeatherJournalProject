# WeatherJournalProject

This is a project for the Udacity Front-End Web Development Nanodegree. This project's focus was on asynchronous calls and client-side/server-side data.

This app creates a weather journal, where the user enters their zip code and how they are feeling. That zip code is used in a call to OpenWeaterMap to get the weather, and the entry is stored.
